      <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
      <div class="exp-subsection">

        <div class="text1">

          <h3>Cyber Security Journey - Clarusway, United States (Sept 2022 – Dec 2023)</h3>
          <p>During this exciting journey, I had the opportunity to master log analysis using the powerful Splunk SIEM
            solution. Collaborating with talented technical teams, we detected and thwarted various cyber attacks,
            including deceptive phishing attempts and malicious URLs. Together, we analyzed and resolved escalated
            cases,
            leaving no cyber security incident unattended!</p>
          <p>I sharpened my packet analysis skills using powerful tools like Wireshark and fought against security
            threats
            using advanced SIEM tools like Splunk, Elastic, Crowdstrike, and IBM QRadar. With my sharp analytical and
            technical skills, I am a quick learner and an unstoppable problem solver.</p>

          <h3>Public Service Experience 2008-2019</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>For approximately the past 10 years, I have had the privilege of serving as the responsible authority
              for
              all general administration in the district. Throughout my tenure, I have effectively managed multiple
              departments, including the Police, Gendarmery (Military), Education & Schools, Healthcare & Hospitals,
              Agriculture & Forestry, Culture & Tourism, Public Finance & Economy, Demography & Citizenship, Religion,
              Land Registry, Youth Services & Sports, and Social Welfare & Assistance.

              Moreover, I have had the opportunity to apply my expertise and leadership skills in five different cities,
              where I oversaw the governance of civil servants and ensured the smooth operation of public services.
              Additionally, as the mayor of rural areas in the district, I have been entrusted with the responsibility
              of
              overseeing vital infrastructure development and maintenance, thereby contributing to the overall growth
              and
              well-being of these regions.</li>

          <h3>Financial Control Expert - Ministry of Finance, Turkey (Sept 2006 – Jan 2008)</h3>
          <p>Before embarking on my public service and Cyber Security adventures, I honed my financial skills as a
            Financial Control Expert at the Ministry of Finance in Turkey. During my tenure, I delved fearlessly into
            the
            world of numbers and calculations, ensuring fiscal stability and accountability by managing Turkey's
            national
            budget.</p>

          <p>I have a wide range of hobbies that keep me engaged and bring me joy. Here are some of my favorite
            activities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I am a big fan of team sports, particularly football and basketball. I enjoy the thrill of competing
              with
              others and working together towards a common goal.</li>
            <li>Exploring the great outdoors is another passion of mine. I love joining hiking groups and embarking on
              adventures through picturesque trails and scenic landscapes.</li>
            <li>Cycling is a great way for me to stay active and discover new places. I often find myself exploring
              various bike trails, taking in the fresh air and beautiful surroundings.</li>
            <li>Swimming is not only a refreshing activity but also a fantastic way to stay fit. I enjoy spending time
              in
              the water, whether it's at the beach or in a pool.</li>
            <li>During the winter months, I eagerly embrace the opportunity to go skiing and snowboarding. There's
              something exhilarating about gliding down the slopes and immersing myself in the snowy mountains.</li>
            <li>Running has become a regular part of my routine. I find it incredibly energizing and it allows me to
              clear
              my mind while improving my physical fitness.</li>
